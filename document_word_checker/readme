How to Use the Script

Prepare the Document:
Drag and drop the Word document you want to process into this folder.

Rename the Document:
Rename the document to text.docx.

Run the Script:
The script will automatically process the file and output a new file named new_text.docx in the same folder.

Description:

This script processes a Word document by scanning through its content and checking if any of the words in the document match a predefined list of target words. When a match is found, the script automatically highlights the word in red, making it easy to identify. The end result is a modified document with all matching words clearly marked in red, which helps users quickly review and edit the document based on the specified list of words.
